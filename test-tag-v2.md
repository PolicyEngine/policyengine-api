# Test Versioned Tag Feature

This is a test file created to test the automatic tag creation and push feature with proper semantic versioning.

- Uses the latest tag to determine the next version
- Checks if a tag already exists before creating it
- Follows semantic versioning (v.n.n.n) format

Date: $(date)
